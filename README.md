# Product-Recommendation-Case-Study-

Welcome to the Product Recommendation Case Study repository. This project focuses on analyzing store performance data to provide senior leadership with strategic recommendations on food and beverage offerings for new store locations.

Project Overview

The company currently operates stores in six states and plans to expand into additional states. This case study aims to determine the optimal product offerings for new store locations, considering the following offerings:

Chicken

Adv GnG (Pizza)

Bean to Cup (Coffee)

Swirl World (Frozen Yogurt)

DoorDash

The analysis evaluates various metrics, such as inside sales, product-specific sales, guest counts, and store type performance, to ensure data-driven decisions. Recommendations will be presented using a detailed Excel analysis and an interactive PowerPoint or PowerBI dashboard.
