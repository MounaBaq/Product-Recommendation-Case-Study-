# Product-Recommendation-Case-Study-
The company currently has stores in 6 states. We are looking to expand stores into additional
states. We have determined the location and store type of the stores, but we have not
determined what food/beverage offers should be at each location. Senior Leadership recently
asked our team to complete a presentation giving recommendations on what offers should be
in each store. The offers we are considering at these stores are Chicken, Adv GnG,(Pizza), Bean
to Cup (Coffee), Swirl World (Frozen Yogurt), and DoorDash. They want the following to be
considered when completing the analysis: Inside Sales, Chicken Sales, Adv GnG (Pizza) Sales,
Bean to Cup Sales, Swirl World Sales, DoorDash Orders, Inside Guest Count, and Store Type.
The locations are listed below, along with the Store Type:
• Travel Center – St George, SC
• 5.5k – Indianapolis, IN
• EDO – Moss Point, MS
• Travel Center – Cleveland, OH
• 5.5k – Murphy, NC
On the “Performance” tab you have all of the information needed to create an analysis on how
stores in other states/locations have performed in the last year per offer based on their store
type. All figures are currently Totals. With the current figures being Totals, you may need to
create metrics to find averages that show how well as store is doing since they’ve been opened.
We’d like you to create an Excel document (please show all of your work) as well as a
PowerPoint or PowerBI Dashboard to present to Senior Leadership with the recommendations
on what offers each new location should have. The PowerPoint/dashboard should include a
summary page of your findings and then 2-3 slides of additional information.
Things to consider:
• In this role we don’t often get clear instructions. Senior Leaders lean on us to tell the
story. Before you begin, we encourage you to go beyond the obvious and present your
findings in a thoughtful way that can answer a plethora of questions that Senior Leaders
would ask you while presenting the data.
• Be mindful of anomalies that show up in the data. We don’t want to misrepresent the
story being told.
• Think outside the box. We might be looking to try new things in new areas. Make sure to
take all data given to you into consideration.
• Formulas are looked highly upon! Feel free to slice and dice the remodel performance
tab all you want to help you get to your final result.
• Don’t hesitate to email us if you have specific questions or data points you’d like to
consider while doing this analysis.
Definitions:
• PSPW: per store per week. It’s simply a store's weekly average
Store Types:
• Travel Center: Larger store with front regular fuel stations and back truck fuel stations.
• They are usually along travel routes. This means they see a lot of traffic from travelers
• but may not be in populated areas.
• EDO: Mid-size store with regular front fuel and an extended diesel offering in the back.
• These stores are a cross between a 5.5k and a Travel Center.
• 5.5K: A regular-sized store with only front regular fuel stations. These are normally,
located in cities (populated areas) but can be located anywhere.
